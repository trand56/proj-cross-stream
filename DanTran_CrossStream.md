# Cross-Stream project


## Project Abstract
This project will allow users to stream videos or surf the web with each other.
There will be one HOST that streams image data to a server or directly to peer.
The peers will pull those image data, buffers them, and display them on their screens.

**The first model is the PEER-TO-PEER model:**


The downside to the P2P model is that it will probably require users to port forward or use a vpn.


**The second model is the REMOTE model:**


The downside to the REMOTE model is that remote servers are expensive and a reliable custom remote server is difficult to set up.


## Project Relevance
This project can be very simple or very complicated. There are room for working with remote servers (like AWS), front end & back end, multi-threading, and networking. 
Not only is it flexible, but it is also useful. The video streaming site https://www.rabb.it/ recently went down and that is what inspired me to propose this project.

Since the project will start from scratch, most, if not all, of these goals will be met:
- Project Management 
- Version Control
- Build 
- Test 
- Issue Tracking  


## Conceptual Design
The networking part and data communication is possible because I have some background on Peer-to-Peer networking along with live data streaming.
If the Remote model is chosen, then I can use some of my knowledge in UI design and also live data streaming.


## Background
The project will not necessarily based on rabb.it but this is the github page:
- https://github.com/Rabbit-Inc

**The github could be useful for any references.**


## Required Resources
- C# and winform or any language with easy-to-implement UI interface
- Web UI
- Node JS technology if web backend is implement
- Backend can also just be simple HTTP servers
- Remote or cloud services like AWS
- No MAC OS
